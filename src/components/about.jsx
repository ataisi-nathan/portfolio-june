                    Hi, I'm Ataisi Nathan, a Full Stack Software Developer with 6 years of experience in Frontend Web Development. I've worked on key projects like AI Chat Lead SaaS and I'm driven by pushing the bounds of technology. Currently studying computer science, I hold certifications in machine learning and frontend development with Meta. My goal is to create software so simple, even a baby could navigate it.
